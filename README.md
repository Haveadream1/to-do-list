# To-do list
To-do list is a project that consists of two parts: the first, where we can create a project to classify our to-do, and the second, the main section, where we can create to-dos that are sorted by date.

Note that the checked or completed todo can be seen separately and all are stored in a local storage.

## Goal
The main goal of the project is to practice the use of the class, set up the environment around it and use the localStorage API.
